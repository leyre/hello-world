# hello-world
Repo to store useful syntax and scripts as I learn various languages/tools.

Currently learning Python via EdX courses and peripherals. Also recently discovered Mimo, so learning some of the basic tracks on there and dabbling with website creation and JavaScript.

Going to use this repo to store the useful scripts and syntaxes I learn along the way, to learn more advanced stuff about Git as I go and have this available anywhere.
